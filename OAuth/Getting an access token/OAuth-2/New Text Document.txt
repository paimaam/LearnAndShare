Assignment - for keyvault https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/keyvault/get-secrets/get-secrets

Graph api - similar to rest, but used to get details of multiple nodes on single request
So far RBAC is used
By defult permission of user.read is configured
Delegated permission - if user logs into app and that app is using application object then app can use all permissions of user

For postman tool (Delegated permssion needs to change to application type) 
For insufficient previlages




Authorization code - 





Authorization code flow

Redirect uri - gets response back froms erver
Hanshake returns code

V2 authorization endpoint - can give scope


Application has to make request to token endpoint - to get token Give authroization code and get token

Use this token for access api


Microsoft identity platofrm helps us implement platform

Default role for graph api - user.read type is delegated

For storage it is user.impersonation
